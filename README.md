# // Value Types vs Reference Types
/*
Value types (Primitives): Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, Undefined, null;

# Value types are independent of each other whereas reference types are
  dependent on each other 

# Primitives are copied by their value
# Objects are copied by their reference

Reference Types: Arrays, Functions, Objects
